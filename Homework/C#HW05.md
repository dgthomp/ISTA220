### Discussion Questions ###

1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?

 It is combination of any arithmetic operator with the assignment operator. They perform operation on the two operands before assigning the result to the first operand

1. List all the compound assignment operators.

 * *=
 * /=
 * %=
 * +=
 * -= **

1. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.

   * Variable = Variable + 5 or Variable += 5
   * Variable = Variable - 50 or Variable -= 50

1. How long does a while loop run?

 It runs continually until the Boolean expression evaluates to false.

1. What is an iteration variable? (Not in book)


1. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?



1. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit
 any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?

 Three Parts: initialization; Boolean expression; update control variable. You can omit any of the three parts of a for statement. If you omit the Boolean expression, it defaults to true, so the  statement runs forever. If you omit the initialization and update parts, you have a while loop.


1. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

 By using a do loop since the Boolean expression is evaluated after each iteration.


1. What does the break statement do?

  The Break statement jump out or exit the loop immediately.


1. What does the continue statement do?
The continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression).

1. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an inﬁnite loop? An “inﬁnite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in eﬀect runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
