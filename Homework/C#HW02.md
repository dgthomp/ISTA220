1. Local variable is any variable you declare inside the body of a method is scoped to that method; it disappear when the method ends and can be accessed only by code running in that method.

1. A statement is a command that performs an action, such as calculating a value and storing the result or displaying a message to a user and ends with a semicolon.

1. Identiﬁers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as namespaces, classes, methods, and variables.

1. A variable is a storage location that holds a value. it is a named location in memory that contains a value with a type.

1. A method is a named sequence of statements.

1. Not all primitive data types are value types. For example, String is a primitive data type but it is not a value type, it is a reference type.

1. Arithmetic operators are use to “operate” on values to create new values.

1. By using the ***ToString*** method.

1. Call the ***System.Int32.Parse*** method

1. Precedence governs the order in which an expression’s operators are evaluated.
  Example: **10 + 2 * 5 is 20** and not **60**
  Associativity is the direction (left or right) in which the operands of an operator are evaluated.
  Example: **10/2 * 5** is **10** not **1.**

1. The definite assignment rule state you must assign a value to a variable before you can use it.

1. The value returned by count++/count-- is the value of count before the increment/decrement takes place, whereas the value returned by ++count/--count is the value of count after the increment takes place.

1. An interpolated string is one that start with the **$** symbol and any expressions between the { and } characters should be evaluated and the result substituted in their place.

1. The var keyword causes the compiler to deduce the type of the variables from the types of the expressions used to initialize them.
